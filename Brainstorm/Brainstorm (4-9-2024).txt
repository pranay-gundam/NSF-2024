So far I see three avenues:
1. Spatial
2. Structural Modeling
3. HANK
4. Some optimization type question (weak)


Within spatial there are really two types of questions:
1. A structural model akin to Dingel and that other Berlin Wall seminal paper
2. Some lights type question, add an econ twist on it related to housing choice


Within Structural Modeling (which is a very broad term), I see the following places:
1. Firm dynamics (exogenous innovation, equity based worker salaries)
2. tbd

Within HANK:
1. something with wage elasticity?
2. This new heterogeneity by specifying racial classes as well


Optimization Problem:
1. Personally, there are a lot of things that come to mind
2. More game theoretical three body problem vibe esque things
